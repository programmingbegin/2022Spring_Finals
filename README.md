# 2022Spring_Finals
Final projects - Supply Chain management Simulation (Reethika Renganathan and Pradyot Dutta)
Understanding of output: -
Currently our output has the following details:
Total Losses made - This is a calculation of the number of days raw materials were insufficient to make the required goods multiplied by the sales price per finished product
Average cost for order quantity: Average cost for all the orders placed and their quanitites
Average days lost is average number of days lost per order 
Average  price per good is: The price we have to assign to each finished product to break even
Average  price per good should have been: The price the finished product would have been if we had been able to complete the order 

Based on the losses and the average price the product should have been we compare the optimized and non optimized versions of the program

Pending work to be added: -
Make a graph to show the quanity where profit is maximum
Set a fixed price for the finished good
Add both functions to a single file and give the option of which one the user wishes to run. or if user wishes to run both for the same quantities
